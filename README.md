# Data analysis for outcomes of Crowdfunding Campaigns

	What are the conclusions we can draw about Crowdfunding campaigns?

To analysis the outcomes, I have created three pivot tables filtered by country, category/sub-category and launch year/month to know whether the outcome is associated with these indicators

1. Overall the funding campaigns has higher than 50% successful rate.
2. The most popular campaign is Plays in Theater and it has the highest successful rate as well. It is more likely to success compared to other funding categories.
3. There is no obvious correlation between the outcome and which month to launch the campaigns during a year.

	Limitations of the dataset

1. The majority of the sample campaigns are in US, hence the analysis may not applicable globally.
2. The data is presented in different currency which will impact the accuracy of the analysis.
3. The sample is too small to represent all the campaigns for 10 years (2010-2020)

	Possible tables/graphs& it’s additional value

A pivot table and combo clustered column-line chart to know the correlation of backer counts/average donation by campaigns categories. 
To know which category has most donors and how much was donated averagely. Show as chart below.
